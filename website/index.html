		<h1>Automotive Engineering</h1>

		<h2>Automotive Basics</h2>
		<p>Today's average car contains more than  15000 separate, individual parts that must work together. These parts can be grouped in four major categories: body, engine, chassis and electrical system.</p>

		<h2>Internal combustion engine</h2>
		<p>The engine acts as the power unit.</p>

		<h2>Powertrain</h2>
		<p>The function of the power train of an automobile is to provide the forces necessary for locomotion.</p>

		<h2>Braking system and body construction</h2>
		<p>A brake system consists of an energy-supplying device, a control device, a transmission device and the brake.</p>
		<p>There are two main ways of building automobiles. They are built body/frame construction and unitized body construction.</p>

		<h2>Steering and suspension system</h2>
		<p>The steering converts the steering-wheel rotary motion into a turn motion of the steered wheels of the vehicle.</p>
		<p>The suspension covers the arrangement used to connect the wheels to the body.</p>

		<h2>Electrical and electronic system</h2>
